                    Since "coding" a typeface without using any design tools is quite limited, I tried to keep the overall shape of letters as simple as possible.
                    <br><br>First of all, I made the weight of the typeface bold. I wanted to design a full-box typeface, so I filled the box first and then took out the empty space. This was also because I wanted to use the minimum component for designing each letter. About four to five rectangles/ovals were used to create one letter on average. For the curved part of the letters, such as counters, I gave a difference in the border radius of the inner and outer sections. You can observe this detail in some specific letters such as E and U.

                For the second assignment, the task was to redesign an existing website. 
                <br> <br>I chose to redesign the OCAD U website because my friends as well as I often felt the structure of it is inconvenient. The biggest inconvenience was that it is too difficult to see the important dates at a glance, so I added a calendar. I also made a new color palette and redesigned the logo as well, as I considered it should be more colorful since OCAD U is the 'art school'.
