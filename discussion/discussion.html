                    <strong>Questions:</strong>
                    <br>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.
                    <br><br>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Can you use a metaphor for describing the internet you inhabit? How does it differ from Schwulst's?
                
                    <br><br><br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <br>1. I agree with the opinion that individual websites are more helpful than social media. Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because most popular social media sites tend to prioritize advertising above their users’ needs. Since they don't focus on users’ happiness, some users often feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. Furthermore, creating a personal website without relying on social media allows creators to explore in many ways. As Laurel Schwwulst mentioned, websites are subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. It helps designers improve their creativity and experience many things.
                    <br><br>
                    2. I can metaphor the internet I inhabit as the universe. These days, there are many archive websites such as Flickr, Pinterest, and Behance. I also spend most of my time surfing such websites. I explore many people's works, learn new things or get ideas there. Sometimes I find the reference I expected, but sometimes I get completely new ideas in a completely different direction. Not only works, but also design, interaction, and everything else is the source of my ideas. I felt that the website is like a universe that doesn't know what is there or how infinite it is.

                        Reading 2: Kathleen and Chris Sleboda. Is The Internet Down?</a>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    <strong>Questions:</strong>
                    <br>1. Is The Internet Down? is a poetic exploration of the culture and history of the internet. In their essay, Kathleen and Chris Sleboda come up with a variety of approaches to the internet: what it means and how it is represented. Pick a detail from the text (an anecdote, a historical detail or a definition) and explain the implications this example carries for the internet at large. How would you define online culture if your chosen example was the axiom? In other words, draw from your example to create a summative statement about the internet and its culture. Do you agree with your summarization or do you feel that something is missing?
                    <br><br>2. What do you think is the relationship between the essay and the artworks? Speculate on the process in which this zine was created. Based on what you’ve read how do you think this project was developed. 
                    <br><br>3. Is there a specific visual piece in this zine that you found particularly compelling? Why?                
                    <br><br><br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <br>1. Nomophobia, also known as a smartphone addiction, is a psychological syndrome that feels a fear of being without a mobile phone. As technology advances, we can solve many different things with just a smartphone. Most of the work ends in just a few touches in a few seconds, without having to deliver letters in person, go to the mart, or go around for information. This is because the wide network of the Internet is located in every corner of the world. The Internet has made our lives more convenient, but over-reliance often harms our lives. For example, people suffering from Nomophobia are afraid of losing access to communication, content, information, apps, and games. In this respect, Internet culture can be summarized as dangerous and negative. I agree with this summarization to some extent, but I am also aware that the benefits of the Internet are also significant. Therefore I believe that it depends on how the user utilizes and controls it.

                    <br><br>2. I think that an essay allows me to picture a scene in my head while reading a combination of words, and the artwork actually embodies it. It can be what I just imagined, or it can be completely different. But what is certain is that both essay and artwork make me able to deeply understand the topic. Reading the paragraph first and then looking at visualization of the text is helpful for deep and repetitive thinking. In the process of reading this zine, I actually read the text first and watched the following images, which helped me understand and think.
                    
                    <br><br>3. I found fig.12 by Sadie Pinn compelling since it represents the dangerous and depressing aspects of the Internet very directly. It is impressive that the intention is conveyed simply but intensely with just a picture of a knotted cable.

                        The author defines the cloud as an aggregation of millions of hard drives, servers, routers, fiber-optic cables, and networks. I was inspired by it and made the shape of a cloud using the images of tangled electrical wires. It was also interesting that engineers at least as early as 1970 used the symbol of a cloud to represent any unspecifiable or unpredictable network, so I added the phrase 'unpredictable network.'
